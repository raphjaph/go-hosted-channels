# go-hosted-channel 
A c-lightning plugin that implements the [hosted-channel-rfc](https://github.com/btcontract/hosted-channels-rfc). 

I just started implementing the codec and no real logic.

This is turning out to be more complicated than I thought. Probably not gonna finish this.

## TODOs
- [ ] for testing: use `getroute` to construct route
- [ ] use correct tlv stream encoding to create hops
- [ ] figure out how to correctly use `createonion` and `sendonion`
- [ ] create trampoline routing module first? easier?
- [ ]
